<!--
    Think of your domain name(town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located 
    (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html
    and /museum/shops/coffe_shop.html). Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from
    the current room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop).
    Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), domain name
    (town.com) and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html):
    https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html
